# Sunday (Swift) [outfoxx/sunday-swift :fontawesome-brands-git-alt:](https://github.com/outfoxx/sunday-swift){ .git-repo-lockup }

A Sunday client library implementation written in Swift and supporting Apple platforms including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS.

!!! tip

    While you can use Sunday (Swift) to write REST clients manually Sunday is most useful when generating clietns from API definitions.

## Installation

Sunday is delivered as a Swift Package Manager package.

Package URL

    https://github.com/outfoxx/sunday-swift.git

Current Release

    {{ sunday.swift.latest_version }}

## Usage

After [installing](#installation) the Sunday (Swift) package int the target project, using Sunday only requires importing the module by name.

```swift
import Sunday
```

### Initializing Service Clients

Service clients need to be initialized with an `RequestFactory` implementation to adapt service methods into network requests.

Sunday's standard implementation of `RequestFactory`, named `NetworkRequestFactory`, is based on Apple's [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession).

You initialize the `NetworkRequestFactory` with a base URL template:

```swift
let baseURL = URI.Template("https://example.com/api/v1");

let requestFactory = NetworkRequestFactory(baseURL: baseURL);
```

#### Customizing Requests

If needed, you can pass an adapter to the initializer to customize generated requests. The adapter allows you to add authorization headers, change the URL or make
any other changes needed to requests generated by the library.

```swift
let baseURI = URI.Template("https://example.com/api/v1");
let authorizer =
    HeaderTokenAuthorizingAdapter(tokenHeaderType: "Bearer", token: accessToken)

let requestFactory = NetworkRequestFactory(baseURI, adapter: authorizer);
```

#### Certificate Pinning

`NetworkRequestFactory` supports certificate pinning for added security.

Passing a `ServerTrustPolicyManager` to the request factory allows configuring server trust globally or on a per host basis.

```swift
let baseURI = URI.Template("https://example.com/api/v1");

let publicKeys = ServerTrustPolicy.publicKeys(in: Bundle.main)
let pinnedTrust = ServerTrustPolicyManager([
    "example.com": ServerTrustPolicy.pinPublicKeys(
        publicKeys: publicKeys,
        validateCertificateChain: true,
        validateHost: true
    )
])

let requestFactory =
    NetworkRequestFactory(baseURI, serverTrustPolicyManager: pinnedTrust);
```
